Then enable the plugin within Rhythmbox (edit->plugins).

** Reporting bugs **

Please report bugs by sending a mail to the author(s).

	*BUG1: It seems to be working properly when playing mp3. But when playing stream radios it has 3 known behaviours:
		1 - It does not updates the song name at the player (program status and tray-icon). Without the plugin it is properly updated.
		2 - It copies properly the name trough the menu_bar command-action
		3 - It locks the player when tray command-action is activated.

This plugin is based on the code repository of the Now Playing Clipboard plugin
